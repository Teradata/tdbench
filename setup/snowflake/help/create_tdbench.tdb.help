------------------------- Help for editing create_tdbench.tdb -------------------------

This script will:
- run the test_connect.tdb script to get the logon and password of the user with rights 
  to execute the create_tdbench.sql

It will then execute the DDL in the create_tdbench.sql file. 

If errors occur, you may need to re-execute the corrected statements using the SQL command, 
or drop the partially created TdBenchDb user, correct the problem and execute create_tdbench.tdb
again.
