This will create the user ${TdBenchDb} to support reporting on DBQL and Resuage
If your ID doesn't have the rights to issue the grants, you may need to logon as DBC.
If you are not allowed to issue some of the grants, the teststart and teststop macros 
will adapt to what is allowed.

Your default DB alias (from tdbench_teradata_lake_config) is: ${TdBenchServer}

If you know the password (e.g. xxxx) to DBC, you can use the command:
   sql ${TdBenchServer}(dbc,xxxx) grant .... 
to override the default credentials. If you need someone else to issue the grants,
you can rerun the create_tdbench.tdb script and ignore the error that user exists.
