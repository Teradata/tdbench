------------------------- Help for tdbench_teradata_config.sh -------------------------

The environment variable settings tdbench_teradata_config.sh are used by the scripts that set up the host DBMS  
reporting. Those scripts need to know the user/database name where the TestTracking table and the reporting
views are stored. The main variables that will be used for all setup situations:

TdBenchServer - defines the alias for the Teradata server as defined by a DB statement in tdbench.tdb
TdBenchDB - defines the database/user where the reporting views and TestTracking table will be stored.
TdBenchPrefix - the prefix used for all worker logon IDs to distinguish benchmark workload from "Noise" from other users

For the Vantage Enterprise Edition, companies use PDCR or their own customized version to move DBQL and possibly
resusage data out of the DBC database to one of the PDCR databases to organize the data for performance and reduce
storage demands within DBC. This data is removed from DBC DBQL and possibly ResUsage tables once or three times per day. 
That would complicate reporting benchmark results if only depending on data in DBC. 

The trigger for enabling PDCR reporting is providing a value for the environment variable TdBenchPdcrDb. 
When that variable is set, reporting views will be created that define a union of data in DBC and PDCR.
The design of those reporting view creation scripts intersects columns of DBC and PCDR such that:
- column differences between DBC and PDCR are supported, especially when companies customize PDCR
- Instead of PDCR, tables may be from a prior release of Vantage and views will union matching columns between releases.

The environment variable names follow a pattern where "TdBenchPdcr" is used as a prefix to the tablename
in PDCR. PDCR used a naming pattern against the DBC table name adding "_Hst" as a suffix. So 
- the DBC table under the DBC.QryLog view which is DBC.dbqlogtbl 
- is the PDCR view PDCRINFO.DBQLogTbl_hst 
- and is referenced by the variable TdBenchPdcrDBQLogTbl

The tdbench_teradata_config.sh have defaults set for the standard PDCR view names. A sample of those:

export TdBenchPdcrDb=
export TdBenchPdcrDBQLExplainTbl=DBQLExplainTbl_Hst
export TdBenchPdcrDBQLObjTbl=DBQLObjTbl_Hst
export TdBenchPdcrDBQLogTbl=DBQLogTbl_Hst
...
export TdBenchPdcrResUsageSawt=ResUsageSawt_Hst
export TdBenchPdcrResUsageScpu=ResUsageScpu_Hst
...

Data in PDCR is partitioned by the column LogDate which is derived from CollectTimeStamp. For compatibility,
the views whether PDCR is used or not synthesize a similar LogDate column derived from CollectTimeStamp.
