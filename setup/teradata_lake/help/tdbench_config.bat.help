------------------------- Help for tdbench_config.bat  -------------------------

With TdBench 8.01.02, there is increased support for doing benchmarks with multiple DBMSs. 
As a result, there may be multiple config.bat scripts, and tdbench_config.bat is the "parent".

Example:
   tdbench_config.bat - defines the jar version and the default TdBench_DBMS
      tdbench_teradata_config.bat - sets up environment variables for scripts to be used with this DBMS
      tdbench_snowflake_config.bat - sets up environment variables for a different DBMS
      ...

A few of the environment variables are used by the setup, however you can reference environment
variables using the same type of syntax used in Linux.  Example: In your ...config.bat you could have:

read -p "Enter your password: " mypassword

and in your TdBench scripts, reference that variable as:  ${mypassword}
... the same syntax is used by TdBench scripts on Windows making your scripts portable. 

Environment variables could be used to specify the path of the SQL scripts that have been 
adapted for each vendor DBMS. The ...config.bat scripts could be used to clean up files from
prior tests or stage fresh data for ETL programs you run using the OS command. 

The default environment variables in tdbench_config.bat are:

TdBench_jar_version - If you've downloaded updated TdBench software, this tells which one you 
   intend to use. If this is not specified and there is more than one, tdbench.bat will prompt
   you each time on which one you want to use.

TdBench_DBMS - This tells the default DBMS being used.  The setting can be overridden with
   the -d parameter on tdbench.bat. The major use of this is for the SETUP command to find the 
   scripts for the DBMS and for this script to determine which vendor specific ...config.bat 
   to run.  For example, if you put on the tdbench.bat command line:
      -d snowflake
   the setting for TdBench_DBMS will be overridden and tdbench_config.bat will execute:
       tdbench_snowflake_config.bat
