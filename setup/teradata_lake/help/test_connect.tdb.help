------------------------- Help for test_connect.tdb -------------------------

This script will validate that environment variables have been set up from tdbench_config.sh/tdbench_config.bat 
and optionally tdbench_teradata_config.sh/tdbench_teradata_config.bat for:

TdBench_DBMS - defines the DBMS (and associated scipt files) to be used by TdBench
TdBenchServer - defines the alias for the Teradata server as defined by a DB statement in tdbench.tdb
TdBenchDB - defines the database/user where the reporting views and TestTracking table will be stored. 

It will then do a simple connection to the DBMS server with your logon ID and password to 
ensure that the CLASS statement and DB statement for the TdBenchServer have been set up correctly. 
Obviously, you will need to define those in the tdbench.tdb or optionally in tdbench_teradata.tdb
files where they are executed everytime TdBench starts.

When creating the DB statement, use the logon and password you intend for the database/user to 
be used after running create_tdbench.tdb.  This script overrides the user and password you put on 
the DB statement (since TdBenchDB hasn't been created yet). 

This is also run from create_tdbench.tdb to get your credentials to set up the database/user
defined by TdBenchDB.
